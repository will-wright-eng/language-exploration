# Go

## ideas

1. A command-line tool: Go is often used for creating command-line tools and utilities. A good starter project could be a simple tool that performs a specific task, such as converting between different file formats or generating random passwords.

2. A web server: Go has a built-in HTTP server package, which makes it easy to create web applications. A good starter project could be a simple web server that serves static files or generates dynamic content.

3. A chat application: Go's built-in concurrency features make it well-suited for creating real-time applications like chat rooms. A good starter project could be a simple chat application that allows users to send messages to each other in real-time.

### Prompt

```bash
sgpt --chat go "is there a repl tool for learning golang?" | tee -a "$filepath"
```

### Response

Yes, there are several REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) tools available for learning and experimenting with Go (Golang). Some popular options include:

1. Go Playground: It is an online web-based REPL tool provided by the official Go website. You can access it at https://play.golang.org/. It allows you to write, run, and share Go code snippets directly in your web browser.

2. Go REPL (Gore): Gore is a command-line REPL tool for Go. It provides an interactive environment where you can write and execute Go code on the fly. You can install it using the following command:
   ```
   go get github.com/motemen/gore/cmd/gore
   ```

3. Go REPL (Gorilla REPL): Gorilla REPL is another command-line REPL tool for Go. It offers a more feature-rich and interactive experience compared to the standard Go REPL. You can install it using the following command:
   ```
   go get github.com/sbinet/gorilla
   ```

These tools can be helpful for learning and experimenting with Go code without the need to compile and run a complete Go program.
