## ideas

1. A command-line tool: Go is often used for creating command-line tools and utilities. A good starter project could be a simple tool that performs a specific task, such as converting between different file formats or generating random passwords.

2. A web server: Go has a built-in HTTP server package, which makes it easy to create web applications. A good starter project could be a simple web server that serves static files or generates dynamic content.

3. A chat application: Go's built-in concurrency features make it well-suited for creating real-time applications like chat rooms. A good starter project could be a simple chat application that allows users to send messages to each other in real-time.
