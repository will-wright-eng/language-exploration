# Lua

## ideas

1. A simple game: Lua is often used for game development, so a good starter project could be a simple game like Pong or Tetris. There are many Lua game engines available, such as LÃ–VE and Corona SDK, that make it easy to get started.

2. A text adventure: Lua is also well-suited for creating text-based games and interactive fiction. A good starter project could be a simple text adventure game, where the player navigates through a story by making choices.

3. A web server: Lua can also be used for web development, and there are several web frameworks available, such as OpenResty and Lapis. A good starter project could be a simple web server that serves static files or generates dynamic content.
