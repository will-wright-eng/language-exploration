# language-exploration

## purpose

- be able to traverse the stack with ease
- languages over tools
- fundamentals over blind execution

```bash
sgpt "what skills are 'boot camp' programers lacking compared to computer programmers that have computer science and engineering degrees?"
```
```
Boot camp programmers may lack a deeper understanding of computer science theory and engineering principles compared to those with formal degrees. They may also have less experience with complex algorithms and data structures, as well as a limited understanding of low-level programming languages and hardware architecture. However, boot camp programmers often have practical skills and experience in specific programming languages and technologies that can be valuable in certain industries.
```

## selection

> look at stackoverflow survey

- popularity trend
- compesation
- geographic job concentration
- ideally: useful & unique
	- "most loved"?
	- small community

```bash
sgpt "what are the most in-demand programing languages that also have the highest pay that are located in the bay area?"
```
```
Based on recent job market trends, the most in-demand programming languages in the Bay Area that also have high pay are:
1. Python
2. Java
3. JavaScript
4. Ruby
5. C++
6. Swift
7. Go
8. PHP
9. Objective-C
10. Kotlin.
```

## languages

```bash
sgpt "which programming languages will make you think differently about how computers work?"
```
```
Languages like Assembly, C, and Rust can make you think differently about how computers work because they require a deeper understanding of the underlying hardware and memory management. Functional programming languages like Haskell and Lisp can also challenge traditional programming paradigms and encourage a different way of thinking about problem-solving.

## projects

> what are common operations I find myself doing across the systems, products, and projects I work on? more importantly, what do I enjoy building?

- hello world
- data analysis
- cli
- api
- web app
- db interactions
- CRUD app
- cloud storage mgmt

## project criteria for success

- run everything from command line (if possible)
- include instructions for setup and execution (bash script or makefile)
- screenshot output
- provide system, version, and environment info (when relevant)
- link to resources used

## dir structure

root / language / project

## future projects

> can this exercise help me build?

- generalizable abstraction layers
- some languages are easier to build in than others

### ideas

- abstract version control code hosting (github & gitlab)
- multi-cloud functionality
