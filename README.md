# language-exploration

## purpose

- be able to traverse the stack with ease
- languages over tools
- fundamentals over blind execution

## selection

> look at stackoverflow survey

- popularity trend
- compesation
- geographic job concentration
- ideally: useful & unique
	- "most loved"?
	- small community

## project criteria for success

- run everything from command line (if possible)
- include instructions for setup and execution (bash script or makefile)
- screenshot output
- provide system, version, and environment info (when relevant)
- link to resources used

## dir structure

root / language / project

## future projects

> can this exercise help me build?

- generalizable abstraction layers
- some languages are easier to build in than others

### ideas

- abstract version control code hosting (github & gitlab)
- multi-cloud functionality
